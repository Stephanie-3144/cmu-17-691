- Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures by Leo Breiman

There are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools. (From Abstract)

Breiman’s article underscores the need for the field of statistics to embrace a broader set of tools beyond traditional data models. By doing so, statisticians can more effectively use data to solve real-world problems, highlighting the importance of predictive accuracy and the utility of algorithmic models in extracting meaningful information from data.

- Software 2.0 by Andrej Karpathy

Andrej Karpathy articulates a transformative perspective in "Software 2.0," positioning neural networks not merely as another tool in the machine learning arsenal but as a paradigm shift in software development. Traditional software (Software 1.0) is crafted through explicit programming in languages like Python or C++, where developers write detailed instructions for desired outcomes. In contrast, Software 2.0, epitomized by neural networks, is "written" by specifying goals and employing computational resources to search for a program that achieves these goals, essentially learning from data. This shift, from explicit programming to training neural networks, alters how software is developed, with significant parts of the process now focused on curating and refining datasets rather than writing code. Karpathy argues this transition towards Software 2.0 offers numerous advantages, including computational homogeneity, simplification for implementation on hardware, and adaptability to scale and complexity, fundamentally changing the landscape of software development and pointing towards a future where AI-driven software development becomes the norm.

- Three Principles for Designing ML-Powered Products by Mark Kizelshteyn and Mat Budelman

Machine Learning (ML) has become a crucial tool at Spotify, enabling personalized recommendations for over 248 million listeners. The company emphasizes the importance of a human-centered approach in designing ML-driven products, warning against solutions that fail to resonate with users. The creation of personalized products at Spotify requires a new mindset, focusing on understanding user needs and business goals. Three principles are proposed for designing ML-powered experiences: 1) Identify and automate away user friction, using ML as a tool to create seamless experiences. For instance, Discover Weekly automates the discovery process by delivering personalized music recommendations, removing the cumbersome effort previously required. 2) Asking the right questions to ensure ML solutions are genuinely addressing user needs, illustrated by the redesign of Spotify’s Home screen to offer personalized recommendations based on deeper user insights. 3) The recommendation to go manual before magical, stressing the importance of understanding and prototyping the user experience before applying ML. This approach is exemplified by Release Radar, where heuristics were used to validate hypotheses about user engagement before applying ML. The article concludes by cautioning against the indiscriminate application of ML, advocating for its use to improve solutions to existing problems more efficiently. These insights highlight the necessity of integrating human-centered design with ML to create products that meet user needs effectively.

- The Data Flywheel: How Enlightened Self-Interest Drives Data Network Effects

"The Data Flywheel" by CB Insights highlights the concept of data network effects, where more users contribute to more data, leading to improved algorithms and products, attracting even more users. Initially struggling to generate a data network effect, CB Insights shifted focus to developing machine learning software for data extraction from unstructured sources, achieving significant success. However, as CB Insights’ newsletter gained popularity and the company received more media attention, people began showing interest in submitting their data, recognizing the potential benefits for their own interests. This shift was driven by enlightened self-interest, where submitting data to CB Insights could result in increased visibility, media exposure, and investor interest. Key strategies that accelerated the data flywheel included creating compelling market maps and rankings, which encouraged startups and investors to submit their data. This submission process not only provided CB Insights with valuable data to refine their algorithms but also created a virtuous cycle of data collection and product improvement, demonstrating the power of data network effects in enhancing service quality and user engagement.

- Defining the Role of Machine Learning in Your App by Apple Human Interface Guidelines

This article discusses the intricate considerations involved in designing machine learning applications, focusing on user experience (UX) design. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the role of machine learning within an app, which can be critical or complementary, private or public, proactive or reactive, visible or invisible, and dynamic or static. It highlights the necessity of designing user interactions, such as explicit and implicit feedback, calibration, corrections, handling mistakes, and managing expectations through limitations. The goal is to create machine learning apps that are intuitive, reliable, and respectful of user privacy, ultimately enhancing the user experience by leveraging machine learning capabilities effectively.

- Software 2.0: Automated route navigation updating
- Autonomous System: Self-Driving Car
  
Self-Driving car also has some drawbacks: risky; product perspective: should consider the willingness to use
